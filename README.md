# Plasma 

Plasma is an open source tool which can be used to create and maintain
end to end ML pipelines. 


## Concepts

#### ML Pipelines

A machine learning pipeline is used to help automate machine learning workflows.They operate by enabling a sequence of data to be transformed and correlated together in a model that can be tested and evaluated to achieve an outcome, whether positive or negative.

#### Components

Basic Building Units of Plasma pipelines, each component denotes a node in
the pipeline graph.

#### Workflow

A YAML defined sequence of operations which orchestrates an end to end ML system.

#### Resources

A data source or a model which can be utilized by components in the pipeline.

## Usage

Run the following commands

    chmod +x plasma
    ./plasma --help
