# Plasma 

Plasma is an open source tool which can be used to create and maintain
end to end ML Workflows. Plasma aims to simpify ML Workflow creation.
This is accomplished by :

 - Creating a registry of reusable opensource components which can be searched and accessed from within plasma.
 - Using simple YAML files to define the workflow instead of complex DSLs or DAGs.

Plasma is a fairly new tool and might not support everything your ML workflow requires.
Hence, new component/feature requests can be raised as Github Issues.
Our project roadmap is also available [publicly](https://github.com/s20ai/plasma/projects/1).

## Usage
